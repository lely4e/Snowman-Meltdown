# ☃️ SNOWMAN MELTDOWN ☃️
Welcome to Snowman Meltdown, a word-guessing game in which you must save the snowman from melting by correctly guessing a hidden word, one letter at a time.

## How to play:
1. A secret word is randomly chosen.
2. You will see a series of underscores (_), one for each letter in the word.
3. Each round, you guess one letter.
4. If the letter is in the word:
    - It will be revealed in all the correct positions.
5. If the letter is not in the word:
    - The snowman will melt a little more.
    - You only have six wrong guesses before the snowman fully melts!


## Rules:
- Enter only one letter at a time.
- Numbers, multiple letters or special characters are not accepted.
- Letters you’ve already guessed won't be accepted again.

Save the snowman by guessing all the letters correctly before making six mistakes!


## After the game:
If you guess the word correctly, you win and the snowman is safe!
If you reach the final stage of the snowman melting, the game ends.
You’ll then be asked if you want to play again.
